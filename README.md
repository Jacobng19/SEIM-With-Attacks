*Ref 1: VM Creation

- The first immediate suspension I see is that in the from section not only is the name "Amazon" spelled wrong but the domain isn't actually coming from Amazon. Clearly, they are trying to impersonate Amazon.

- The intended recipient of the email appears to only go to one user but it would still be important to verify only one user in the company was affected.

- The subject line does raise a concern to me as it implies some urgency on the recipient, although not always an immediate reason for phishing it is a common breadcrumb
